Parallel Coordinates modified form an example at https://syntagmatic.github.io/parallel-coordinates/
Data from http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Diagnostic)

This web page uses parallel coordinates to display the 10 attributes of the data.
The color is based on the diagnosis of cancer cells, red and blue for malignant and benign respectively.
This page will handle additional rows of data and additional columns of data.
A different csv file can be used with some small edits to the javascript.

Technical/Biological additions
